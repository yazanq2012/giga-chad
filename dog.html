The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant<br>
        of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from an ancient, extinct<br>
        wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog<br>
        was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 <br>
        years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long<br>
        association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic <br>
        individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would<br>
        be inadequate for other canids.[11]<br>

The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory<br>
        capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape,<br>
        size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,<br>
        pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship,<br> 
        therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely<br>
        adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent<br>
        study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[14]<br>
