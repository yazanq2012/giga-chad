The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable<br>
        for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates,<br>
        such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large <br>
        contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay<br>
        with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving<br>
their mother's home range to establish their own.<br>
The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia<br>
        Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of<br>
        the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have<br>
        lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia,<br>
        the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains <br>
        of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate<br>
        forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian<br>
        island, Sumatra.<br>
The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was<br>
        estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most populations living in small<br>
        isolated pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population <br>
        decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife <br>
        conflict, due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density.<br>
The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured<br>
        prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and <br>
        continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms<br>
        and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia<br>
        and South Korea.<br>
