        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family<br>
        Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4]<br>
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats<br>
        are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat<br>
        registries.[6]<br>

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,<br>
        and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat<br>
        communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as<br>
        cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary<br>
        hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those<br>
        made by mice and other small mammals.[7] Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[8]<br>

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five<br>
        kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.<br>
        Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment<br>
        of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird,<br>
        mammal, and reptile species.[10]<br>

        It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100<br>
        BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in<br>
        Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13]<br>

        As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15]<br>
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats<br>
        owned[16][17][18] and around 42 million households own at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26%<br>
        of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[20]<br>
