        he lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,<br>
        broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at<br>
        the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger <br>
        than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups <br>
        called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, <br>
        and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large<br>
        ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge<br>
        when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically<br>
        does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
        The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal <br>
        than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and <br>
        at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast<br>
        Europe, the Caucasus, Western Asia and northern parts of India, but it has been reduced<br>
        to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.<br>
        It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations <br>
        in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations<br>
        are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not<br>
        fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.<br>
        One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively<br>
        depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. <br>
        Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species<br>
        sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural<br>
        depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all <br>
        ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.<br>
